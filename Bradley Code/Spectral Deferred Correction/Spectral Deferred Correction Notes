Spectral Correction v1 
Not included doesn't work as intended

Spectral Correction v2
Uses the Euler method to get initial approx u_hat values with equidistant nodes t_j
Uses the u_hat values to get the approx f_hat values
Uses these f_hat values to get the lagrange interpolating polynomial f_pol of f(u, t)
Integrates f_pol from a to t_j using Newton-Cotes quadrature to get residuals
Calculates approx errors using u_hat values and residuals
Added global error against interval size plot

Spectral Correction v3
Only change is that initial approx u_hat values now use Chebyshev nodes t_j with Euler method
