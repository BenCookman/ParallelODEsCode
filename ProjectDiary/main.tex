\section{October $5^{\text{th}}$, 2022 - 11:00-11:40}
In this meeting, we reviewed the general plan of the project. We got to know about Brad and Ben's background and interests. We briefly discussed discretisation in time and space and I explained the focus of this project is time integration. I shortly mentioned why parallelisation in time is challenging. Ben and Brad showed interest to pick Julia as the programming language for this project. We decided to use Git/Github as the main platform for sharing files and scripts and collaboration.

\textbf{Assignment of the week} \newline
Brad and Ben will familiarise themselves with Git/Github, review classical time integrators and write scripts that solve simple ODEs using these integrators. Several sources for numerical ODEs (as well as a package for using Git/Github) were shared with them.

\section{October $12^{\text{th}}$, 2022 - 11:00-11:40}

Brad and Ben shared their progress during the last week. They had coded Forward Euler and multi-step time integrators and used them to find the numerical solution of a few ODE examples. We talked about Spectral Deferred Correction method briefly and took a loot at the paper by Dutt et al. (2000). 
\begin{shaded}
\textbf{Assignment of the week} \newline
Brad and Ben will present error and convergence plots in their reports for classical integrator. They will read Dutt et al. (2000) and try to implement it.
